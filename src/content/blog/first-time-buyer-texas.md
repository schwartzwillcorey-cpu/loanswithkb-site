Buying your first home in the Dallas-Fort Worth area or East Texas doesn't have to feel overwhelming. This guide will walk you through down payment options, loan programs, and what to expect as a first-time buyer in Texas.

## Key Takeaways

- You don't need 20% down—FHA loans require just 3.5%, conventional loans as little as 3%, and VA loans $0 down
- Texas has no state income tax, but property taxes are higher (1.5%–2.5% of home value annually)
- Pre-approval strengthens your offer in competitive DFW markets like Rockwall, Heath, and Forney
- Your monthly payment includes principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and HOA fees (if applicable)
- Most first-time buyers qualify for more than they expect—schedule a Discovery Call to find out your budget

## Understanding Your Down Payment Options

One of the biggest misconceptions about buying a home is that you need 20% down. That's simply not true, especially for first-time buyers.

**FHA Loans** require as little as 3.5% down and are ideal if you're still building credit or have limited savings. These government-backed loans are designed specifically to help first-time buyers get into homeownership.

**Conventional Loans** can require as little as 3% down for qualified buyers. If you have good credit and stable income, this can be an excellent option with competitive rates.

**VA Loans** require $0 down if you're a veteran or active military. This is one of the best loan programs available, and I work with many military families in the DFW and Tyler areas.

## What You Can Afford in Dallas-Fort Worth and East Texas

The DFW metro and East Texas offer a wide range of price points, making homeownership more accessible than you might think.

In areas like Rockwall, Heath, and Forney, you'll find newer construction and family-friendly communities with strong schools. Tyler and the surrounding East Texas region offer excellent value with lower property prices compared to the metro.

During your Discovery Call, I'll run the numbers with you to show exactly what you can afford based on your income, debts, and down payment. Many first-time buyers are surprised by what they qualify for.

## Texas-Specific Considerations

Texas has no state income tax, which can improve your debt-to-income ratio compared to other states. However, property taxes are higher here (typically 1.5% to 2.5% of home value annually).

Your monthly mortgage payment will include:
- Principal and interest
- Property taxes (held in escrow)
- Homeowners insurance
- HOA fees (if applicable)

I'll help you understand the full cost so there are no surprises.

### What This Means for Texas Buyers

Property tax rates vary by county. In Dallas County, expect 2.0%–2.5% of assessed value. Tarrant County (Fort Worth) runs 1.9%–2.3%. Smith County (Tyler) is typically 1.8%–2.2%.

On a $300,000 home with a 2.2% tax rate, that's $6,600 per year or $550 per month. This is why understanding your full monthly cost is critical before you start shopping.

## Getting Pre-Qualified vs. Pre-Approved

**Pre-qualification** gives you a rough estimate based on basic information. It's quick and helps you understand your budget.

**Pre-approval** involves a more thorough review of your finances and documentation. It shows sellers you're a serious buyer and can strengthen your offer in competitive markets.

We'll discuss which option makes sense for you during your Discovery Call based on where you are in the process.

## Common First-Time Buyer Questions

**Do I need perfect credit?**
No. FHA loans accept credit scores as low as 580, and conventional loans typically start at 620. If your credit needs work, I can refer you to resources that help.

**What if I'm self-employed?**
Self-employed buyers can absolutely qualify. You'll need to provide tax returns and proof of income, but there are loan programs designed for non-traditional income.

**Can I buy if I have student loans?**
Yes. Lenders consider your debt-to-income ratio, but student loans won't disqualify you. We'll factor them into your monthly budget during pre-approval.
