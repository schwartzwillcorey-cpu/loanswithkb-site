                <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
                <p>I've helped hundreds of families in Texas navigate one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. What drives me isn't closing loans—it's the moment when a first-time buyer gets their keys, or when a family realizes they can finally afford the home they didn't think was possible.</p>
                <p>I became a mortgage loan officer because I saw too many people confused by the process, pressured by aggressive lenders, or simply given up on homeownership because they thought it was out of reach. I knew there was a better way—one built on clear communication, honest guidance, and putting your goals first.</p>
                <p>Getting a mortgage shouldn't feel overwhelming. My job is to make the process clear, manageable, and focused on what matters most to you. Whether you're buying your first home, upgrading, or refinancing, I'll help you understand your choices and find the loan that fits your situation—without the pressure or confusion.</p>
