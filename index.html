                        <p>It depends on your current rate, how long you plan to stay in the home, and your financial goals. We can run the numbers together to see if it makes sense.</p>

                        <p>Texas has no state income tax, but property taxes are higher than many states (typically 1.5-2.5% of home value annually). Your monthly mortgage payment includes property taxes divided into 12 monthly payments held in escrow. I'll help you understand the exact tax burden for any home you're considering.</p>

                        <p>Texas buyers benefit from no state income tax, which can improve your debt-to-income ratio. However, property taxes and homeowner's insurance (especially wind/hail coverage) are higher. I work with many relocating clients and can walk you through Texas-specific considerations, from MUD districts to HOA fees, so there are no surprises.</p>
