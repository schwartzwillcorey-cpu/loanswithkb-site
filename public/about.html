                <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
                <p>I've helped hundreds of families navigate one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. What drives me isn't closing loans, it's the moment when a first time buyer gets their keys, or when a family realizes they can finally afford the home they didn't think was possible.</p>
                <p>I became a mortgage loan officer because I saw too many people confused by the process, pressured by aggressive lenders, or giving up on homeownership because they thought it was out of reach. I knew there was a better way: one built on clear communication, honest guidance, and putting your goals first.</p>
                <p>Getting a mortgage shouldn't feel overwhelming. My job is to be your trusted advisor through the entire process. I'll help you understand your options, clarify what's realistic, and guide you toward the loan that truly fits your situation, without pressure, without confusion, and with complete transparency.</p>
